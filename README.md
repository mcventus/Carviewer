## Components

- Major project components:
  - Data responsible for for processing API calls
  - Header to contain title and Nav component 
  - Home to serve as landing page
  - Main responsible for routing 
  - Nav as navigation bar for components 
  - Footer to contain copyright information 

### MVP

- The landing page will give general information on how to use the react app
- when user views the landing page there must be a search bar avaliable to view images
- once the user write int the search bar to look for vehcile information, the react app must display all primary data 
- if the user clicks on one of the listed vehicle data then the user must be able to view detailed information about the vehicle or car 
- All the above happens on the main component and when user wants to go to listing component, there must be a button to click to go back 

## Additional Requirements

- there will be a register and login components available for the user
- when user login and search for car data his search history could be saved to be available when user login another time
- background music must play to make the game interesting

## Project Schedule

|  Day | Activities | Done
|---|---| ---|
|Feb 24| Brainstorming / Writing Pseudocodes / Identifying All Constraints | Yes
|Feb 24-25| Setting up project components/ Testing if each components are functioning with out error | Yes
|Feb 26-27| Implementing major functions and use react cross-component communicators or built in functions to save application data states and control life cycle of project components  | yes
|Feb 28| Finising up the application, testing and deploying  | No



## Additional Libraries Plugins and APIs

- Axios which is used to communicate with the backend and it also supports the Promise API that is native to JS ES6. It is a library which is used to make requests to an API, return data from the API, and then do things with that data in our React application.
- Google font API - used for styling fonts 



## Problems and Solutions 

- Difficult to find good car API that provides both text and image data 

## Code Snippet

Smooth implementation of functionalities and calling them at runtime


```

     const getCarData = async () => {
            axios.request(options).then(function (response) {
                console.log("SUCCESS: "+response);
                setCarData(response)
            }).catch(function (error) {
                console.error(error);
            });
        }
        getCarData()
    }, [])

```

## Surge Deployment Link

- Major components such as Home, About, Login, Logout and other aplication specific components added.
